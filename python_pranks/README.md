send anything to your friends line by line 
## install python on your device 
if python isnt preinstalled on your device, install it <a href = "https://www.python.org/"> here </a>. 
## instal pip 
if you don't have pip installed on your device, follow the instructions for your operating system <a href = "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/"> here </a> 
## install pyautogui
do this by simply opening the command line and copy pasting 'Python -m pip install pyautogui' into the command line 

## add your specific prank 
in script.txt, alter the text to be anything you want to prank your friends with, whether that be the original all star by smashmouth lyrics or something else. <i> remember to save your words </i> 

## get ready. 
the code only gives you 5 seconds after it starts before it begins typing, so open up the texting platform of your choice next to the command line

## pranking time 
navigate to where you cloned the git repository and in the command line, type python shrek.py and then click on the text box in the texting platform, then wait. you should begin to see your text sent line by line. 

(you may have to give your command line permission to control your computer for this to work)
